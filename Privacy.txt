Prevention of Fraud
In our ongoing efforts to safeguard our services and users from fraudulent activities, We may process personal data to identify, prevent, and address instances of potential fraud. This includes measures such as flagging suspicious activities, like initiating chargebacks immediately after making a reservation, and may result in barring individuals suspected of fraud from future use of our website.

We maintain a database of individuals suspected of fraudulent activities, which is used solely for the purpose of protecting our services and users. The retention period of data in this database is determined based on its necessity for fraud prevention and is regularly reviewed to ensure compliance with data protection laws. 

Additionally, We retain the right to share this information with reputable and trusted third parties that operate in the field of fraud prevention, such as Ekata (https://www.ekata.com). In sharing this data with third parties, We will operate in a manner that respects privacy laws and the rights of the individuals concerned, ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations and legal requirements.

This includes transfers within our organization, to governmental bodies, and to our reliable business associates. For example, your personal data, including sensitive data when necessary, might be distributed to entities such as airline companies, hoteliers, insurance entities, and Global Distribution Systems (GDSs), for the purpose of facilitating the travel services and reservations you request. In addition We transfer your data to financial institutions, acquiring banks, PSP and fraud prevention providers in order to allow the payment of the service purchased.

In which case your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers and will be passed to the new owners or merger or other relevant corporate transactions.
